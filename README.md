## Overview

This project automates the extraction of medical information from images and texts using machine learning techniques. It integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from web scraping medical information.

### Features

- **OCR Integration**: Convert medical images to text for digital processing.
- **NER Model**: Named Entity Recognition for accurate medicine name extraction.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Mixtral-8x7B for advanced natural language processing tasks.
- **Web Scraping**: Collects and processes medical data from diverse sources for training.
